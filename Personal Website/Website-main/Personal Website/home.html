        My name is Vincent Saponaro and I would like to welcome you to
        my personal website. Whether you are a security researcher, IT 
        professional, or someone a little more interested in what I'm up 
        to, I'm glad you stopped by!
        </p>

        <h3 class="typesec2">info --me // Short Bio</h3>
        <p> 
        Let me tell you a bit about me right off the bat and if you like 
         what you read you can go to the about me section where theres even more!
         I am currently pursuing a Bachelors degree in Cybersecurity and a Masters
         degree in Risk, Policy, and Compliance at SUNY University at Albany. So far
         I've loved the journey I have been on and being here has taught me a lot. For 
         as long as I can remember I have had a burning passion for technology and that 
         includes a passion for system and internet security. 
        <br></br>
        My passion for security derives from my interest in understanding how systems and the internet
         works at a low level, how data moves through networks, and how vulnerabilities can be exploited
         or mitigated and those who choose to use these exploits for a variety of factors.
         Whether it comes to protecting sensitive data or investigating the latest cyber threats,
         my goal is to make the digital world a safer place for those that roams it (which is everyone now).
        <br></br>
         If you'd like to hear more about me from the experiences I've had which includes previous internships, related 
         projects, and extra work experiences I have had outside of tech, now would be a good time to check out the about me section!
         I hope to see you there!
        </p>
