            <h3>Welcome to My Story!</h3>

            <p> Welcome to the About Me Page! This is where you'll learn more about my journey into the world of technology and cybersecurity. From a young age, technology has been
                more than a hobby for me - It has been my passion and now it has become my career path. As I continue to pursure both my undergraduate and graduate degrees in Cybersecurity
                at SUNY Albany, I am constantly exploting how I can make an impact in the field, both through academic achievement and hands-on experience.
                <br></br>
                In this section, I will share my educational background, professional goals, and my evolving journey in the field of cyberseucirty. Whether you are hear to learn more
                about my experience, my aspirations, or just to connect, I hope my story gives you a deeper look into my passion for securing the digital world.

                        <p>I am currently pursuing both my under graduate and graduate degrees in Cybersecurity at SUNY Albany. 
                        The program has given me a solid foundation in cybersecurity principles while also allowing me to explore more advanced
                        topics such as networking at an advanced level, policy and frameworks, and courses in penetration testing.

                <h2>Professional Goals</h2>
                    <p>My current goal is to become a Cybersecurity Engineer, where I would be focused on the designing, implementation, and maintaining of secure systems
                        which I would help harden to withstand the evolution of continuous cyber threats. I'm passionate about combining technical skills with staregies and 
                        ways to help organizations plan ways to protect their networks and systems. My aim is to work in roles that would allow me to tackle real world cybersecurity
                        challenges whether it's safeguarding systems from vulnerabilities or developing advanced security frameworks that organizations can rely on.
                        <br></br>
                        Before I complete my undergraduate Cybersecurity degree, I feel like it would be very vital to get a CompTIA Security+ 701 certification which I have been considering
                        very much recently. I feel like studying for certifications such as the CompTIA Security+ and Network+ would leave me in a good position to demonstrate my foundational knowledge
                        in both cybersecurity and network security. These certficiations would also make me more competitive in the job market, where certifications such as these are pretty standard across the industry.
                        By obtaining these certifications, I will be better equiped to proetct systems and networks from potential threats, and it will provide me with a recognized credential that validates my skills and knowledge in the field.

                <h2>Background and Journey</h2>
                <p>Ever since I was young, I have always had an interest with technology which grew more and more into a passion as I have gotten older. I never knew that I would want to pursue a career in technology
                    when I was younger because I never felt like there was a lot of talk about working in tech at the time, but now it feels like tech is so engraved in our lives its almost impossible to not notice it even if 
                    you are trying not to. I was given the oppurtunity to explore the internet freely when I was younger and I feel like a lot of my love came from that. Constantly being on the computer for hours at a time feel like an 
                    hour in my head was one of the best parts of being a child to me because of how assessible everything was whether it was videogames and other media or information as a whole. I feel like information should 
                    be avaliable to those that wish to access it and that is one of the reasons I love the internet so much even if it gets a bit hectic at times. As I grew older, my curiosity about how everything worked behind the scenes began
                    to flourish. I started to dig deeper into the inner workings of computers and I wanted to learn as much as I could about them. 
                    <br></br>
                    Once I got to the University at Albany I still didnt have much of a clue what I wanted to do so I went
                    in undecided but as time continued and I saw a lot of what my school had to offer I took courses in a bunch of different subjects from political science, art history, computer science, and cybersecurity. I wanted to learn how to code 
                    in highschool but I never knew where to start and when I did start I would get lost in the process. The classes I took relating to informatics and cybersecurity took what I liked the most about computers and put it into one subject and I soon 
                    changed my major to Cybersecurity not long after that. The idea that I could help safeguard critical systems and information from malicious atttacks became a driving force behind my decision, especially if it meant if I got to help people
                    and learn more about the systems I loved to interact with on a surface level. Cybersecurity is more than just preventing breaches; to me its about ensuring that the information remains accessible and safe for those who rely on it. This aligns with my
                    belief that knowledge and access to information should be avaliable to everyone who seeks it if given the proper authorization without the fear of exploitation.
                    <br></br>
                    Now, as I take on a dual degree program and work toward becoming a cybersecurity engineer, I feel empowered by the idea of being on the front lines of protecting the digital world and the assets of organizations. The field of cybersecurity is constantly evolving
                    and I am excited to be apart of a community that strives to stay ahead of new threats and maintain the integrity of vital systems that so many people use on a day to day basis. There is a lot more I have to learn but I am eager to embrace the challenges ahead. every new skill I aquire
                    whether through corusework, hands on projects, competitions, internships, and certifications, brings me one step closer to achieving my goal. I understand that cybersecurity is not only about technology, but also about strategy, lateral thinking, and staying adaptable in a landscape that
                    changes by the minute. As I continue to grow in this field, I am committed to sharpening my technical expertise while also expanding my understanding of policy, risk management, and how cybersecurity impacts not just systems, but people and industries on a global scale. The journey ahead 
                    is bound to be rigourous but the oppurtunity to make a tangible difference in protecting critical infrastcture and the digital lives of individuals keeps me motivated and wanting to learn even more.
