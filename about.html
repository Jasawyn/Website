                        Welcome to the About Me Page! This is where you'll learn more about my journey into the world of technology and cybersecurity. From a young age, technology has been
                        more than a hobby for meâ€”it has been my passion, and now it has become my career path. As I continue to pursue both my undergraduate and graduate degrees in Cybersecurity
                        at SUNY Albany, I am constantly exploring how I can make an impact in the field, both through academic achievement and hands-on experience.
                        <br><br>
                        In this section, I will share my educational background, professional goals, and my evolving journey in the field of cybersecurity. Whether you are here to learn more
                        about my experience, my aspirations, or just to connect, I hope my story gives you a deeper look into my passion for securing the digital world.

                    <p>My current goal is to become a Cybersecurity Engineer, where I would be focused on the design, implementation, and maintenance of secure systems
                        which I would help harden to withstand the evolution of continuous cyber threats. I'm passionate about combining technical skills with strategies and 
                        ways to help organizations plan for protecting their networks and systems. My aim is to work in roles that would allow me to tackle real-world cybersecurity
                        challenges, whether it's safeguarding systems from vulnerabilities or developing advanced security frameworks that organizations can rely on.
                        <br><br>
                        Before I complete my undergraduate Cybersecurity degree, I feel it would be vital to get a CompTIA Security+ 701 certification, which I have been considering
                        recently. I believe studying for certifications such as CompTIA Security+ and Network+ would position me well to demonstrate my foundational knowledge
                        in both cybersecurity and network security. These certifications would also make me more competitive in the job market, where certifications like these are standard across the industry.
                        By obtaining these certifications, I will be better equipped to protect systems and networks from potential threats, and it will provide me with a recognized credential that validates my skills and knowledge in the field.

                    <h2>history -view "Background Overview"</h2>
                    <p>Ever since I was young, I have always had an interest in technology, which grew more and more into a passion as I have gotten older. I never knew that I would want to pursue a career in technology
                        when I was younger because I never felt like there was a lot of talk about working in tech at the time, but now it feels like tech is so ingrained in our lives it's almost impossible to not notice it even if 
                        you are trying not to. I was given the opportunity to explore the internet freely when I was younger, and I feel like a lot of my love came from that. Constantly being on the computer for hours at a time felt like an 
                        hour in my head was one of the best parts of being a child to me because of how accessible everything was, whether it was video games, media, or information as a whole. I feel like information should 
                        be available to those who wish to access it, and that is one of the reasons I love the internet so much, even if it gets a bit hectic at times. As I grew older, my curiosity about how everything worked behind the scenes began
                        to flourish. I started to dig deeper into the inner workings of computers and I wanted to learn as much as I could about them. 
                        <br><br>
                        Once I got to the University at Albany, I still didn't have much of a clue what I wanted to do, so I went in undecided. However, as time went on and I saw a lot of what my school had to offer, I took courses in a bunch of different subjects, from political science, art history, computer science, and cybersecurity. I wanted to learn how to code 
                        in high school, but I never knew where to start, and when I did start, I would get lost in the process. The classes I took relating to informatics and cybersecurity took what I liked the most about computers and put it into one subject, and I soon 
                        changed my major to Cybersecurity not long after that. The idea that I could help safeguard critical systems and information from malicious attacks became a driving force behind my decision, especially if it meant helping people
                        and learning more about the systems I loved to interact with on a surface level. Cybersecurity is more than just preventing breaches; to me it's about ensuring that the information remains accessible and safe for those who rely on it. This aligns with my
                        belief that knowledge and access to information should be available to everyone who seeks it, given the proper authorization without the fear of exploitation.
                        <br><br>
                        Now, as I take on a dual degree program and work toward becoming a cybersecurity engineer, I feel empowered by the idea of being on the front lines of protecting the digital world and the assets of organizations. The field of cybersecurity is constantly evolving,
                        and I am excited to be part of a community that strives to stay ahead of new threats and maintain the integrity of vital systems that so many people use on a day-to-day basis. There is a lot more I have to learn, but I am eager to embrace the challenges ahead. Every new skill I acquire,
                        whether through coursework, hands-on projects, competitions, internships, and certifications, brings me one step closer to achieving my goal. I understand that cybersecurity is not only about technology, but also about strategy, lateral thinking, and staying adaptable in a landscape that
                        changes by the minute. As I continue to grow in this field, I am committed to sharpening my technical expertise while also expanding my understanding of policy, risk management, and how cybersecurity impacts not just systems, but people and industries on a global scale. The journey ahead 
                        is bound to be rigorous, but the opportunity to make a tangible difference in protecting critical infrastructure and the digital lives of individuals keeps me motivated and wanting to learn even more.
