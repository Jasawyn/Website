                    <h2>./BadUSB_Exploit.exe (Bad USB)</h2>
                    <p> 
                        During this project, myself and two other colleagues conducted an in-depth exploration of BadUSB vulnerabilities, focusing on how malicious USB devices can be weaponized to compromise systems through privlege escalation, automated
                        execution, and malware deployment. The main objective was to demonstrate how simple, inexpensive hardware such as an ATTINY85 microcontroller programmed to act as a Human Interface Device (HID) could be leveraged
                        to bypass traditonal security measures and execute high impact payloads without triggering user suspicion. The ATTINY85 functioned as the delivery mechanism, automatically injecting PowerShell commands the moment it plugged into 
                        a Windows system, effectively mimicking legitimate keyboard input at a fast pace. One of the most important components of this project involved integrating XenoRAT as the proof of concept payload. 
                        <br><br>
                        Because XenoRAT is typically flagged immediately by Microsoft Defender and other security solutions, it was vital to work around these detections to fully demonstrate how attackers can obfuscate or encrypt malware binaries before deploying them.
                        To accomplish, we downloaded XenoRAT from a reputable online repository specifically for research purposes and encrypted the executable using TripleDES encryption to prevent Defender from detecting it during transit and initial execution.
                        I wrote PowerShell scripts capable of encrypting and decyrpting the payload on the victim machine, allowing us to store the malware in an obfuscated format, deliver it silently, then decrypt and execute it locally without raising immediate alerts.
                        This process demonstrated the practical reality of how attackers evade static signature-based detection tools, despite the presence of endpoint defenses.
                        <br><br>
                        Beyond encryption and evasion, we developed several PowerShell scripts to showcase different attack vectors that can be executed through BadUSB delivery, including automated modification of system settings, manipulation of user configurations, privlege escalation chains.
                        These scripts were designed not only to deploy the RAT but to demonstrate the broader security risks associated with physical access attacks. How a simple USB device can alter a systems enviorment, spawn hidden processes, or modify registry values silently in a matter of seconds.
                        Each component of the script was carefully crafted to simulate realistic adversarial behavior while staying within the ethical boundaries of controlled research in an isolated enviorment. 
                        <br><br>
                        As part of the project deliverables, my colleagues and I created a presentation and research paper
                        documenting our foundigns, methodologies, and challenges. These materials were presented to peers and instructors to help illustrate the real world risk of BadUSB attacks and the ease with which they can be executed. By explaining not only how the attack worked but also why it worked, showcasing
                        the gaps in device trust, endpoint protection, and physical security policies, we were able to reinforce the importance of defense-in-depth strategies and USB control policies.

                    <h2>404: Sleep Not Found (24hr Gamejam Edition 2024)</h2>
                    <p> 
                        During the Month of November, 2024 myself along with 6 others particpated in a 24 hour gamejam to develop the Unity-based game Skeleton Crew.
                        My primary contributions involved designing and implementing the UI and UX elements to ensure intuitive and responsive player interactions which include 
                        menus, HUD components, and control feedback. Additonally, I created several character sprite animations, rigging and importing them into Unity and scripting animation triggers 
                        to synchronize with gameplay events. Beyond UI/UX and animations, I assisted in playtesting to help identify bugs and provide feedback that I would mark down and send to the main coders.
                        <br><br>
                        Experiencing this gamejam was very different compared to the other competitions I have been apart of because of the pace, scope of collaboation, and the creative freedom involved.
                        Unlike cybersecurity competitions which I am more custom to, they often follow a structured problem solving framework with defined rules and clear objectives, the gamejam required us to
                        think creatively in real time while balancing technical constraints and artistic vision. I had to quickly adapt to Unity's engine features which I have never used previously, learn new scripting techniques 
                        on the fly with guides and youtube videos explaining the processes, and troubleshoot unexpected issues under a strict time limit and hundreds of other participants that probably knew more than me and my team.
                        This intense enviorment taught me how to prioritize tasks efficiently and make fast yet uninformed decisions, while iterating on ideas rapidly without losing the site of the overall game design. 
                        <br><br>
                        Team collaboration also felt entirely different in this context. Whereas cybersecurity competitions often involve smaller teams working in parallel on discrete tasks, the gamejam demanded constant communication, coordination,
                        and shared ownership of every aspect of the project, which involved everyone on the team screaming when they would commit to the Git repo and to make sure everybody pulled and on the same page. Managing these dynamics under pressure 
                        highlighted the importance of adapitability and clear communication when building a complex project in such a short amount of time. Overall the experience broadened my technical skill set in Unity and deepened my understanding
                        of how large-scale creative projects function as a team, while strenghtening my ability to perform under tight deadlines.
