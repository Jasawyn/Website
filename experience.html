                            <h3>Cyber Informed Engineering and AI Lab Research Intern | August 2024 - January 2025</h3>
                            <p> Throughout my time as a Research Intern at the AICIE lab, I was tasked with conducting extensive research
                                on cybersecurity risks facing industrial control systems (ICS) across critical infrastructure sectors which include energy, water, 
                                and manufacturing. I then authored a research paper throughout my time, proposing a tailored cybersecurity framework for ICS environments that 
                                aligned with industry standards such as NIST SP 800-82, IEC 62443, and NERC CIP. My work involved analyzing real world case studies to identify 
                                common threat vectors and using those insights to inform framework design. I evaluated eisting ICS security practices and reccomended system specific 
                                countermeasures that balance operational performance and safety. I also presented my findings in a formal research poster and participated in a networking
                                event addressing emerging challenges in ICS cyber defense.

                            <h3>Hack IoT Cybersecurity and Privacy Research Intern | January 2024 - May 2024</h3>
                            <p>During my time as a Cybersecurity and Privacy Research Intern at the HackIoT Lab, I focused on identifying 
                                and addressing security vulnerabilities in Internet of Things (IoT) devices. I performed penetration testing
                                on a range of systems, from commercial IoT products to household devices, uncovering weaknesses that 
                                could be exploited by attackers. My research also involved developing protocols to strengthen the security
                                of these devices ensuring they were better protected against potential threats. In addition to all of that, 
                                troubleshooting played a significant role in my day-to-day activities in the lab. It would be my job to restore
                                systems to a secure and operable state while implementing measures to prevent system failures for future system use.
                                This experience deepened my understanding of IoT security and the challenges posed by the growing number of connected
                                devices in modern networks.

                        <p>This was the most recent CTF I was a part of. During this CTF which lasted 24 hours, a team consisting of myself and four others were tasked with completing challenges in categories
                            that vary from Forensics, Industrial Control Systems, Hardware, Web Exploitation, and Reverse Engineering. I have never been a part of a CTF that offered challenges in reverse engineering,
                            hardware, and ICS, so it was very educational to be a part of a team that knew what they were looking for when it came to those challenges and to see their thought process behind it. The 
                            event was hosted on Hack the Box and I thought it was overall very educational and very fun. I learned a lot of new ways to reverse engineer with files and got to use SQLi on a deliberately vulnerable
                            website which helped deepen my understanding of web exploitation and security vulnerabilities. This CTF not only enhanced my technical skills but also adds to my passion for cybersecurity and teamwork
                            in high-pressure environments.
