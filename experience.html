                            <h3>University at Albany Makerspace Lab Intern | August 2024 - Present</h3>
                            <p>As a lab intern at the Makerspace at SUNY Albany, I have worked on a variety
                                of projects where I am able to gain hands-on experience with advanced technologies
                                such as 3D printers, laser cutters, cricut machines, and microcontrollers such as Arduino
                                and Raspberry Pis. My role involves assisting community members with their technical projects, guiding
                                them through troubleshooting and offering creative solutions. I have developed a strong proficiency in
                                using CAD and Blender software to design prototypes and models, while also performing routine maintenance 
                                on the equipment to ensure it's functioning properly. Overall, I try my best to incorporate the 4 C's of 
                                the Makerspace which keeps the lab running, which is Creativity, Critical Thinking, Collaboration, and Communication.

                            <h3>Hack IoT Cybersecurity and Privacy Research Intern | January 2024 - May 2024</h3>
                            <p>During my time as a Cybersecurity and Privacy Research Intern at the HackIoT Lab, I focused on identifying 
                                and addressing security vulnerabilities in Internet of Things (IoT) devices. I performed penetration testing
                                on a range of systems, from commercial IoT products to household devices, uncovering weaknesses that 
                                could be exploited by attackers. My research also involved developing protocols to strengthen the security
                                of these devices ensuring they were better protected against potential threats. In addition to all of that, 
                                troubleshooting played a significant role in my day-to-day activities in the lab. It would be my job to restore
                                systems to a secure and operable state while implementing measures to prevent system failures for future system use.
                                This experience deepened my understanding of IoT security and the challenges posed by the growing number of connected
                                devices in modern networks.

                        <h3>Cyber Defense Organization Member | September 2024 - Present</h3>
                        <p>As a current and active member of the Cyber Defense Organization (CDO), I have gained valuable hands-on experience in both
                            offensive and defensive security practices that I am grateful to the organization for. I regularly participate in red/blue team 
                            exercises, simulating real-world cyber attacks and defenses. In these exercises, I focus on identifying vulnerabilities and implementing
                            defensive measures. I've also deployed proficiency with essential cybersecurity tools, such as Nmap for network scanning and Wireshark for 
                            traffic analysis, which I use to assess and monitor system security. Additionally, I have worked on configuring firewalls and Intrusion Detection
                            and Protection Systems to enhance the network security of our simulated environments. My involvement in Capture the Flag competitions has honed my problem
                            solving skills and I am proud to have contributed to my team's first-place victory in a competition with 17 different teams. Working in virtual environments,
                            I set up and managed isolated systems to safely test and explore cybersecurity tools, further refining my skills in a practical setting.

                        <p>In this Capture the Flag competition, I competed with members of the UAlbany campus and community that decided to partake in the event to solve
                            complex cybersecurity challenges. The categories of the challenges included categories such as cryptography, OSINT, web exploitation, and other key 
                            categories relating to internet and system security. The objective was to complete as many puzzles as possible within the allotted time to accumulate 
                            points and achieve a higher score than competing teams. My team's ability to rapidly analyze problems and apply different tools and techniques from the 
                            GUI to the terminal helped us secure first place among 17 teams. This competition strengthened my problem-solving skills and deepened my knowledge of 
                            cybersecurity concepts in a hands-on and fast-paced environment.

                        <p>The Hivestorm Cybersecurity Competition provided an opportunity to apply defensive cybersecurity skills in a high-stakes simulated environment. As a part of
                            a team of myself and a colleague of mine, we worked to secure vulnerable virtual machines varying in difficulty where we identified security weaknesses within 
                            the systems and applied best practices to secure them against potential attacks. This involved configuring firewalls, updating software, managing user permissions,
                            and ensuring security policies were properly implemented on Linux and Windows machines. The competition required us to methodically assess each system's vulnerabilities
                            and improve its security posture to score higher than other teams. This experience enhanced my skills in system administration, vulnerability management, and proactive
                            defense strategies, all within a competitive and timed environment.

                        <p>This was the most recent CTF I was a part of. During this CTF which lasted 24 hours, a team consisting of myself and four others were tasked with completing challenges in categories
                            that vary from Forensics, Industrial Control Systems, Hardware, Web Exploitation, and Reverse Engineering. I have never been a part of a CTF that offered challenges in reverse engineering,
                            hardware, and ICS, so it was very educational to be a part of a team that knew what they were looking for when it came to those challenges and to see their thought process behind it. The 
                            event was hosted on Hack the Box and I thought it was overall very educational and very fun. I learned a lot of new ways to reverse engineer with files and got to use SQLi on a deliberately vulnerable
                            website which helped deepen my understanding of web exploitation and security vulnerabilities. This CTF not only enhanced my technical skills but also adds to my passion for cybersecurity and teamwork
                            in high-pressure environments.

                        <p>Ever since I was a young teenager I was working as a logistical assistant at Hutch Design located in NYC. At Hutch, I was helping streamline the shipping process to reduce 
                            delays and ensure timely deliveries for customers. My responsibilities included identifying ways to simplify and optimize daily operations, which improved overall productivity
                            for the logistics team and other teams across the office. Additionally, I supported office functions by delivering financial documents and assisting with office setups whether 
                            it is assembling furniture, troubleshooting systems, or reorganizing the inventory we had in stock in the warehouse. My role at Hutch not only allowed me to develop my logistical 
                            skills but also gave me experience in problem-solving and process improvement.
