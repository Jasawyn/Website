                        <p>As a lab intern at the Makerspace at SUNY Albany, I have worked on a variety
                            of projects where I am able to gain hadns on experience with advanced technologies
                            such as 3D printers, laser cutters, cricut machines, and microcontrollers such as Arduino
                            and Raspberry Pi's. My role invovles assisting community members with their technical projects, guiding
                            them through troubleshooting and offering creative solutions. I have developed a strong profiecncy in
                            using CAD and Blender software to design protytpes and models, while also performing routine maitneance 
                            on the equipment to ensure its functioning properly. Overall, I try my best to incorprate the 4 C's of 
                            the Makerspace which keeps that lab running which is Creativity, Critical Thinking, Collaboration, and Communication.

                        <h3>Hack IoT Cybersecurity and Privacy Research Intern | Jaunary 2024 - May 2024</h3>
                    <p>During my time as a Cybersecurity and Privacy Research Intern at the HackIoT Lab, I focused on identifying 
                    and addressing security vulnerabilities in Internet of Things (IoT) devices. I performed penetration testing
                    on a range of systems, from commercial IoT products to household devices, uncovering weaknesses that 
                    could be exploited by attackers. My research also involved developing protocls to strengthenn the seucurity
                    of these devices ensuring they were better protected against potential threats. In addition to all of that, 
                    troubleshooting played a signficiant role in my day to day activities in the lab. It would be my job to restore
                    systems to a secure and oeprable state while impleneting measures to prevent system failures for future system use.
                    This experience deepened my understanding of IoT security and the challenges posed by the growing number of connected
                    devices in modern networks.

            <h3>Cyber Defense Organization Member | September 2024 - Present</h3>
                <p>As a current and active member of the Cyber Defense Organization (CDO), I have gained valuable hands on experience in both
                    offensive and defensive security practices that I am grateful to the organization for. I regularly participate in red/blue team 
                    exercises, simulating real-world cyber attacks and defenses. In these exercised, I focus on identifying vulnerabilities and implementing
                    defensive measures. I've also deployed proficiency with essential cybersecurity tools, such as Nmap for network scanning and Wireshark for 
                    traffic analysis, which I use to assess and monitor system security. Additionally, I have worked on configuring firewalls and Intrusion Detection
                    and Protection Systems to enhance the network security of our simulated enviorments. My involvement in Capture the Flag competitions has honed my problem
                    solving skills and I am proud to have contributed to my team's first place victory in a competition with 17 different teams. Working in virtual enviorments,
                    I set up and managed isolated systems to safely test and explroe cybersecurity tools, further refining my skills in a practical setting.

            <h3>University at Albany State of Grace CDO CTF</h3>
                <p>In this Capture the Flag competition, I competed with members of the UAlbany campus and community that decided to partake in the event to solve
                    complex cybersecurity challenges. The categories of the challenges included categories such as cryptography, OSINT, web exploitation, and other key 
                    categories relating to internet and system security. The objective was to complete as many puzzels as possible within the alloted time to accumulate 
                    points and achieve a higher score than competing teams. My teams ability to rapidly analyze problems and apply different tools and techniques from the 
                    GUI to the terminal helped us secure first place among 17 teams. This competition strengthened my problem-solving skills and deepened my knowledge of 
                    cybersecurity concepts in a hands on and fast-paced enviorment.

            <h3>Hivestorm Cybersecurity Competition</h3>
                <p>The Hivestorm Cybersecurity Competition provided an oppurtunity to apply defensive cybersecurity skills in a high-stakes simulated enviorment. As a part of
                    a team of myself and a colleague of mine, we worked to secure vulnerable virtual machines varying in difficulty where we identified security weaknesses within 
                    the systems and applied best practices to secure them against potential attacks. This invovled configuring firewalls, updating software, managing user permissions,
                    and ensuring security policies were properly implemented on Linux and Windows machines. The competition requried us to methodically assess each systems vulnerabilities
                    and improve its security posture to score higher than other teams. This experience enhanced my skills in system administration, vulnerability management, and proactive
                    defense strategies, all within a competitive and timed enviorment.

        <h3>North East Collegiate Cyber Defense League (NECCDL) CTF</h3>
                <p>This was the most recent CTF I was apart of. During this CTF which lasted 24 hours, a team consisting of myself and four others were tasked with completing challenges in categories
                    that varief from Forensics, Industrial Control Systems, Hardware, Web Exploitation, and Reverse Engineering. I have never been apart of a CTF that offered challenges in reverse engineering,
                    hardware, and ICS, so it was very e ducational to be apart of a team that knew what they were looking for when it came to those challenges and to see their thought process behind it. The 
                    event was hosted on Hack the Box and I thought it was overall very educational and very fun. I learned a lot of new ways to reverse engineer with files and got to use SQLi on a deliberately vulnerable
                    website which helped deepen my understanding of web exploitation and security vulnerabilities. This CTF not only enhanced my technical skills but also adds to my passion for cybersecurity and teamwork
                    in high-pressure enviorments.

                <p>Ever since I was a young teenager I was working as a logistical assistant at Hutch Design located in NYC. At Hutch, I was helping streamline the shipping process to reduce 
                    delays and ensure timely deliveries for customers. My responsiblities included identifying ways to simplift and optimize daily operations, which improved overall productivity
                    for the logistics team and other teams across the office. Additionally, I supported office functions by delivering financial documents and ssisstant with office setups whether 
                    it is assembling furniture, troubleshooting systems, or reorganizing the inventory we had in stock in the warehouse. My role at Hutch not only allowed me to develop my logistical 
                    skills but also gave me experience in problem-solving and process improvement.
